Displays a prompt where you can enter new commands.
Just like bash, it can find and run the correct executable (using the PATH variable, relative or absolute path).
I implemented the following built-in functions to make it work like bash:
echo with option '-n'
cd using only relative and absolute paths
pwd without option
Export without options
set without option
no env option and no arguments
no option exit
Inside the door, as in Bash; You can separate commands.
The 'I' is implemented to behave like Bash except for multi-line commands.
Redirect < > ">>" works like Bash except that file descriptors are collected.
pipe | It works like bash.
Environment variables (occurs after $) behave like Bash.
$? It works like bash.
'Ctrl-C, ctrl-D, ctrl -' gives the same result as Bash.
About
